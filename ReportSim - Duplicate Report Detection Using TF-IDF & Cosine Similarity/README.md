# ðŸ“Š ReportSim - Duplicate Report Detection Using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity

A lightweight Python tool to find similar or duplicate `.txt` reports using Natural Language Processing.

---

## ðŸš€ Features

- Compare a specific report with all others
- Cosine similarity scoring (0â€“100%)
- Clean text preprocessing (lowercasing, symbol removal)
- Export results to Excel
- CLI-based input (choose report name)
- Scales to 25+ reports easily

---

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. Load and clean all `.txt` reports from a folder
2. Convert each report into a vector using **TF-IDF**
3. Ask user to enter a target report (e.g., `report12.txt`)
4. Compute **cosine similarity** with all other reports
5. Display and save a ranked similarity list
